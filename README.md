# renju_pvs

This a task for myself.

I realized PVS search algorithm and Zobrist Hash to save repeated situation, it works great.

there is MTD(f) algorithm here, It's confused to me that it doesn't faster than others.

Hope to help you in some cases.And maybe you had solve these problem, I will appreciate that you tell me.

I have solve the difference from PVS and MTD in some ways, but I don't know why yet.

A bad news is that Zobrist error will appear in some cases, like back to first few steps. Maybe it will return abnormal result even it doesn's work.
