# renju_pvs

This a task for myself.

I realized PVS search algorithm and Zobrist Hash to save repeated situation, it works great.

there is MTD(f) algorithm here, It's confused to me that it doesn't faster than others.

Hope to help you in some cases.And maybe you had solve these problem, I will appreciate that you tell me.

I'm sorry that my code is messy and if you don't mind, please do it yourself.

**Tips：use release to speed up.**

**PVS  depth：8-12 in 10s **

**MTD depth：8-12 in 10s**

**Killer depth：12-20 in 10s **
